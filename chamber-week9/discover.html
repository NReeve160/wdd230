                    <img src="images/adventureland.webp" alt="picture of Main Street" loading="lazy">
                    <p>Main Street USA is the first sight that you encounter when you first enter the Magic 
                        Kingdom at Walt Disney World. This is also the street area that you see on both sides 
                        as you look down upon the view of Cinderella‚Äôs Castle. It is no doubt that the area 
                        would be impressive since this is your first impression of the park. I love Main 
                        Street and could spend a ton of time enjoying the shopping, treats, entertainment, 
                        and views.</p>

                    <h1>Central Hub</h1>
                    <img src="images/centralwheel.webp" alt="picture of Partners Statue" loading="lazy">
                    <p>The Magic Kingdom Hub is known as a central point in the park before Magic Kingdom 
                        branches out into its famous themed lands (Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, etc.)
                        You can think of this as a bicycle wheel where all of the tiny metal bars (spokes) intersect 
                        at the middle of the wheel at what typically looks like a metal cap (hub).The name Hub comes 
                        from what's known as the Hub-Spoke distribution model. Simply put, spokes are the paths that 
                        extend out from a central meeting point, known as a Hub. While the themed lands of the Magic 
                        Kingdom are not all directly connected to each other, the themed lands are almost all connected 
                        to the Magic Kingdom Hub. It's a very open, circular area that's popular for fireworks and 
                        parade viewing, as well as a meeting point for friends and family before heading off to 
                        experience the attractions of Magic Kingdom.</p>

                    <img src="images/fantasyland.webp" alt="picture of Fantasy Land" loading="lazy">
                    <p>Fantasyland is one of the most popular lands within the Magic Kingdom for its size, number of 
                        attractions, and characters. It has the highest presence of Disney characters and direct 
                        representation from so many of our favorite movies and stories.</p>

                    <img src="images/tomorrowland.webp" alt="picture of Tomorrow Land" loading="lazy">
                    <p>Tomorrowland is a land within the Magic Kingdom that helps to transport us to a 
                        community of tomorrow.  The attractions, characters, and experiences fit in with 
                        the theme of the land.  The land had a lot of history and special touches from Walt himself.</p>

                    <p>Frontierland is the area of the Magic Kingdom where you can experience the 
                        ‚Äúwildest ride in the wilderness‚Äù and a lot of other rootin‚Äô tootin‚Äô fun!  
                        The theme taken from the ‚Äúwild west‚Äù is a lot of fun and is an experience 
                        that you won‚Äôt find in many other places.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Adventureland is a lovely area within the Magic Kingdom. The area is so green and lush, 
                        and you have the sounds of energizing drums and beats that you can‚Äôt help but feel your 
                        adrenaline rise in the area. We love the mix of different countries and experiences and 
                        definitely venture here frequently to go on Pirates of the Caribbean!</p>
