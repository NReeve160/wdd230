					<h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

					<p>When landing on this page you only have access to 3 things. The menu button, a shopping cart button, 
					   and a button to take you to the last episode. The rest of the design is white space; white space with 
					   design and art inside of it, but still white space. It makes the website look clean as well as guiding
					   the user to where the most important content is.

					<h2>Fitts Law</h2>

					<p>This website makes everything you need accessible immediatly. You can tap on the products picture to 
					   immediatly be taken to the store. No movement of the courser and barely requiring the thumb to move
					   as little as possible. The other option is subscribe, which is also within easy reach of the thumb.
					   The user has to do almost no movement in order to access any of the content they may want on the site.

					<h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
					<p><a href="https://www.awkwardzombie.com/" target="_blank">awkwardzombie.com</a></p>					
					<img src="images/zombie.png">
					<p>Visual Heirarchy is demonstrated on this page u sing text. The top point of the page is the font based
					   logo, which is also the biggest text on the page. The next item is the Menu button, which is nearly as 
					   big and provides access to the rest of the website. Besides that it is only the comic, which is the 
					   content people are going to the website for.
