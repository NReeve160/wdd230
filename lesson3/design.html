            <h2>Color SCheme</h2>
            <p>The color schemes ibased around the colors of the Disney Castle. Most of it is going
                to be different shades of blues which will alternate. The Purple will be used on temporary
                areas or ones which are going to showing up on larger screens. The light blue is what will
                be used to highlight and outline the header and footer. Text will all be in black, except in 
                places where that does not provide enough contrast. Instead that be in one of the shades of 
                blue.

            <h2>Typography - Headings</h2>
            <p>The heading typography is a seriff font called 'Playfair Display.' It is a similar a fancy
                type of design which makes me think of Disney. It gives a older time period feeling which 
                works well with the Magic Kingdom.
            </p>
            <h2>Typography - Paragraphs</h2>
            <p>I went with a sans seriff font for the regular text on the page. 'Comfortaa' is exactly
                like it sounds, a very comforting font. It has a consistent weight and rounded edges,
                which makes it more friendly for kids and continues to be readable through long paragraphs.
