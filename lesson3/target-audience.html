            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>The primary target audience is going to be divided into 
                two different groups. Parents who are between the ages of
                22 to 35 with small children, and Young Adults between 
                the ages of 20 to 30. 
                Both groups will be first time visitors to the magic kingdom
                and have a vested interest in knowing what there is to do
                at the Disney Magic Kingdom outside of going on rides.
            </p>

            <h2>Persona 1</h2>
            <p>We are young parents who are visiting Disney World for the 
                first time. We are bringing our two children, who are 6 and 9.
                We would like to be able to know what stores, restraunts,
                and activities are available in the Magic Kingdom. We are 
                especially interested in knowing where play areas that don't have
                lines and good places to cool down on a hot day are.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Persona 2</h2>
            <p>I am a young adult who is part of the Disney College Program.
                I have a lot of time that I will be going to the park. I have gotten
                a lot of advice from friends and seniors in the program, but it
                is a lot to keep track of. I would like to know what kinds of places
                are good for me to visit on a regular basis or might be interesting 
                but less popular. 
            </p>

            <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
            <p>It is a hot day and I am worried about my kids over heating. I want to
                get them some Ice Cream, and I also want to be able to sit down and rest.
                I have seen a lot of the carts that have Mickey Bars, but they don't really
                have any places to sit down. What are some good places we could stop
                in order to get a treat and sit down, preferably with air conditioning. 
            </p>
            <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
            <p>I am wanting to get a special toy for my daughter. She really loves Disney 
                princesses. My husband is taking her on the It's a Small World ride. This 
                has given me a chance to go and find something to surprise her with. where 
                is a good store to go shipping for Disney Princess things?
            </p>
            <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
            <p>I am visiting the parks for the first time with my apartment. We are all coming
                to the parks for the first time and we want to know some of the smaller
                stores or restraunts. There are a lot of places that are super popular, but 
                we know that there are places that are less well known. 
            </p>
            <h2>Scenario 4</h2>
            <p>I am coming to the park for the first time all on my own. I have visited
                a few times with family or friends. It is the middle of July and it is 
                super hot. I want to know some good places I can go to cool off when 
                standing in lines in this heat has worn me out. 
            </p>
